NAM String matching tool is designed for the purpose of cross-referencing 2 string phrases/characters from distinct .xlsx Excel spreadsheet columns.
It applies the following algorithms:

- Levenshtein distance - string metric for estimating the similarity between the 2 sequences;
- Numpy/Pandas - libraries for handling 25k+ rows of data by aggregating, filtering, sorting and manipulating the input;
