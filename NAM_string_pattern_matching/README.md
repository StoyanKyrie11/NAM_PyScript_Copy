# Project Name

NAM_string_pattern_matching
NAM String similarity pattern matching. Output provisioned in %.

# Problem

The NAM string pattern matching is developed with the purpose of solving the following scenario:
- read 2 .xlsx Excel spreadsheet documents with a vast row count as input data;
- preprocess and filter/group/reformat the data inputs via numpy and pandas libraries;
- implement logic for reading the data from 2 columns situated in the 2 distinct spreadsheets;
- apply the Levehnstein distance string metric/fuzzy Wuzzy algorithm with the purpose of estimating the similiarity
between the string phrases passed as arguments

# Outcome

The NAM String pattern matching script managed to output the percentage % match between the 2 distinct string phrases. 
Default passing threshold - 80%.


# Solution

NAM String matching tool is designed for the purpose of cross-referencing 2 string phrases/characters from distinct .xlsx Excel spreadsheet columns.
